# Need4Stream

Need4Stream is a data-mining project that models how online piracy (for games/films/series) evolves in relation to macro and market drivers like inflation (CPI), streaming price hikes, and platform fragmentation. We ingest public datasets (CPI, a long-format streaming price history, and a multi-platform catalog) and build a monthly EU panel per country (scripts/aggregate_kaggle.py). In a feature-engineering step (notebooks/build_index.py), we derive a proxy PiracyIndex (blend of price pressure, fragmentation, CPI, and optionally Google Trends/DMCA), add time features (seasonality), lags/rolling stats, and trim to periods with real coverage. We then train decision-tree models (src/models.py) to explain/predict PiracyIndex and report MAE/RMSE plus feature importances (e.g., CPI vs. PriceBasket vs. fragmentation). The result is a clean monthly_panel.csv you can analyze, visualize, or extend with events (DNS blocks, major releases) to test causal hypotheses about what drives piracy.

To reproduce, place raw datasets under data/raw, convert/move to data/processed, then run the pipeline: python scripts/aggregate_kaggle.py → python notebooks/build_index.py → train with python src/models.py --csv data/processed/monthly_panel.csv. You can visualize the continuous piracy evolution using python scripts/plot_piracy.py --country Romania, which saves EU-wide and per-country charts in data/processed. The model currently uses decision trees with time-series CV and reports MAE/RMSE and feature importances, letting you test how CPI, subscription prices, and fragmentation relate to piracy over time.
